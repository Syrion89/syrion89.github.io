Hi, my name is Raffaele and I’m a Penetration Tester.

I took a Master’s Degree in Network and Software Technologies at University of Salerno, Italy and I'm a Offensive Security Certified Professional.

I like to challenge myself with “Capture the Flag”, learn new attack and defense strategies, and play the guitar.
